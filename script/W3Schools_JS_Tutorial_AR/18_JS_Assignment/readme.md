JavaScript Assignment Operators
Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.
Given that
x = 10
and
y = 5
, the table below explains the assignment operators:
Operator
Example
Same As
Result
=
x = y
x = y
x = 5
+=
x += y
x = x + y
x = 15
-=
x -= y
x = x - y
x = 5
*=
x *= y
x = x * y
x = 50
**=
x **= y
x = x ** y
x = 100000
/=
x /= y
x = x / y
x = 2
%=
x %= y
x = x % y
x = 0
:
x: 45
size.x = 45
x = 45
Logical Assignment Operators
Operator
Example
Result
&&=
true &&= 10
x = 10
||=
false ||= 10
x = 10
??=
null ??= 10
x = 10
The = Operator

Try it Yourself »
The += Operator
The
Addition Assignment Operator
Can also be used to add strings.

The &&= Operator
The
Logical AND assignment operator
is used between two values.
If the first value is true, the second value is assigned.
Logical AND Assignment Examples
let x = true;
let y = x &&= 10;
Try it Yourself »
let x = false;
let y = x &&= 10;
Try it Yourself »
let x = 1;
let y = x &&= 10;
Try it Yourself »
let x = 0;
let y = x &&= 10;
Try it Yourself »
let x = undefined;
let y = x &&= 10;
Try it Yourself »
let x = null;
let y = x &&= 10;
Try it Yourself »
Note
The
&&=
operator is an
ES2020 feature
.
The ||= Operator
The
Logical OR assignment operator
is used between two values.
If the first value is false, the second value is assigned.
Logical OR Assignment Examples
let x = false;
let y = x ||= 10;
Try it Yourself »
let x = true;
let y = x ||= 10;
Try it Yourself »
let x = null;
let y = x ||= 10;
Try it Yourself »
let x = undefined;
let y = x ||= 10;
Try it Yourself »
Note
The
||=
operator is an
ES2020 feature
.
The ??= Operator
The
Nullish coalescing assignment operator
is used between two values.
If the first value is undefined or null, the second value is assigned.
Nullish Coalescing Assignment Examples
let x;
x ??= 10;
Try it Yourself »
let x = 0;
x ??= 10;
Try it Yourself »
let x = null;
x ??= 10;
Try it Yourself »
let x = undefined;
x ??= 10;
Try it Yourself »
let x = 10;
let y = 5;
x ??= y;
Try it Yourself »
Note
The
??=
operator is an
ES2020 feature
.
The Spread (...) Operator
The
...
operator splits iterables into individual elements.
Example
let text = "12345";
let min = Math.min(...text);
let max = Math.max(...text);
